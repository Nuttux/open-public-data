-- Mart: SF budget by fiscal year — net adopted totals per side
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, core_us_sf_population (per-resident),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance — dataset page URL +
--          rows_updated_at as the export `as_of`).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side (Revenue | Spending), FY2010-FY2027.
--
-- The totals are NET because the negative "Transfer Adjustment" rows stay
-- in (docs/us/API-RECON.md §A.1) — naive SUM(budget_amt) is correct
-- precisely because of them; transfer_adjustment_usd shows how much they
-- net out per year. Revenue = Spending per FY within $10 (balanced budget,
-- tested in tests/us/assert_us_sf_budget_revenue_equals_spending.sql).
--
-- per_resident_usd only exists where a same-year Census estimate exists
-- (2020-2025); SF FY N ends Jun 30 of year N, so the July 1 estimate of
-- year N is the FY-end population.
