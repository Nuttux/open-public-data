-- Mart: SF payees — per-fiscal-year context for the who-gets-paid page
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers, core_us_sf_contracts (grant join),
--          stg_us_sf_payee_buckets, stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year (one row per FY, FY2007-FY2027).
--
-- Everything the page hero and per-year header need, measured not assumed
-- (docs/us/block-studies/2-payees.md):
--   - PERIMETER SPLIT: total = ALL payments through the City's financial
--     system, incl. is_related_govt_unit=true flows ($5.46B / 33% of
--     FY2025 — pension benefits, health-system premiums, GEN debt service,
--     college district). The split is exported so the hero can label it;
--     never netted silently (cross-cutting rule 4).
--     related_top_departments carries the top 4 related-entity department
--     lines so the label's composition comes from data, not copy.
--   - BUCKET COVERAGE per FY: share of vendor-attributed $ whose vendor is
--     classified in the seed. 65.6% FY2025 / 64.0% FY2026 vs ~26-32%
--     pre-2018 at seed v1 — the UI renders a coverage badge when low
--     (Paris "données brutes" honesty pattern).
--   - NONPROFIT slice (FY2018+ ONLY — non_profit_indicator is empty before
--     FY2018, measured 0 rows 2007-2017): totals, distinct orgs, share,
--     top department. NULL pre-2018, not 0.
--   - GRANT lens (FY2018+ ONLY — contract numbers start with PeopleSoft):
--     vouchers paid under 'Grant Contract%' contracts. NULL pre-2018.
--   - execution_status enum (cross-cutting rule 2).
