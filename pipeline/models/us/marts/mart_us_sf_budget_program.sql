-- Mart: SF adopted budget by program — the operating/capital/admin strip
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × program.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A STRIP AND NOT A DRILL LEVEL (measured, docs/us/
-- block-studies/1-budget.md §1): from FY2019 the program dimension collapses
-- to ~10 generic activity tags (Operating / Capital / Administrative /
-- Maintenance…) — median 3 per department. Programs are NOT navigable
-- content in the modern era; they support exactly one operating/capital/
-- admin KPI strip. FY2010-FY2017 has 291-324 real department-specific
-- programs — a different, legacy taxonomy. n_programs_in_fy lets the export
-- decide whether the strip is renderable (modern years) or omitted (legacy
-- years), without hardcoding a year boundary. FY2018 excluded (mixed
-- systems).
