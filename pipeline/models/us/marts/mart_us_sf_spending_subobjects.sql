-- Mart: what San Francisco actually buys — spending by sub-object
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers (row-level payment lines),
--          stg_us_sf_subobject_class (purchase / obligation / ledger),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:   fiscal_year × sub_object_code.
--
-- Replaces a hand-curated six-line "what a payment buys" strip with the whole
-- ledger, split honestly. Two design decisions worth keeping:
--
--  1. SUB-OBJECT, not object. The object level is too coarse to read: one
--     $3.4B bucket called "Professional/Specialized Svcs" (FY2025, 20% of all
--     payments). Sub-object splits it into Other Professional Services /
--     Management Consulting / Engineering / Systems Consulting.
--
--  2. FY2018+ ONLY. The chart of accounts was renumbered at FY2018 — the same
--     concept is `567 Blds;Structures & Improvements` until FY2017 and
--     `BLD_STR_IMP Bldg: Structures/Improvements` after. Codes are stable
--     WITHIN each era (0 codes carry two labels) but not across it, so a
--     series spanning the break would silently split. Same FY2018 cliff the
--     payee and contract drills already respect.
--
-- The exemplar is DERIVED (the largest vendor × department line in the cell),
-- never curated: it cannot be cherry-picked and it refreshes each year on its
-- own. Related-government-unit lines are excluded from the exemplar only, so
-- a category is never illustrated by an internal transfer — the totals still
-- carry every dollar.
--
-- `top_payees` is the drill list behind a clicked category. It ranks positive
-- lines only, but — unlike the exemplar — it does NOT exclude related
-- government units. That exclusion is right for an ILLUSTRATION (a category
-- should not be introduced by an internal transfer) and wrong for a LISTING:
-- the City's health-plan categories are paid entirely through the Health
-- Service System, a related unit, so excluding them left those categories
-- with an empty drill list and made Kaiser's and Blue Shield's own fiches a
-- column of dead labels. A reader opening a category wants everyone who was
-- paid in it; the paying department is on every row and says what it is.
