-- Mart: SF adopted budget by character — the economic altitude
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, stg_us_sf_character_glosses, stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × character (26 spending / 20 revenue characters
--         per modern FY — the Paris "poste" analogue; revenue characters are
--         the most citizen-readable label set in the dataset).
--
-- FY2018 excluded (corrupted-drill year — mixed chart-of-accounts systems).
-- display_category (seed) drives UI placement: standard → ranked bars ·
-- internal → internal-mechanics block (IntraFund Transfers In, Expenditure
-- Recovery) · adjustment → ELU/ELS labeled lines · offset → Overhead and
-- Allocations. Negatives never enter share/length visuals.
