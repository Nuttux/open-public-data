-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF vendor payments (vouchers), department × character cells —
-- "who actually got paid" for a slice of the adopted budget
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers, stg_us_sf_payee_buckets (display bucket),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × department × character × vendor, ranked within
--         cell by $, top 15 vendors kept per cell.
--
-- WHY dept×character, NOT dept×object (measured, docs/us/block-studies/
-- 1-budget.md §6 — the join test): dollar-vs-dollar match between adopted
-- budget and voucher payments is 90.3% of nonzero-budget $ at dept×
-- character and does NOT improve at dept×object — budget often sits on a
-- "-Budget" placeholder object code while payments post to a sibling
-- detail code (e.g. DPH FY2024 budgets $10.9M at object 538000 "CBO
-- Services - Budget" and $0 at 538010 "Community Based Org Srvcs" where
-- the vouchers actually land). Object-level payment DETAIL still renders
-- (objects_top3 upstream in mart_us_sf_top_payees) — this mart is the
-- dept×character comparison grain only.
--
-- cell_total_usd / cell_n_vendors are windowed BEFORE the top-15 cut, so
-- they stay accurate even though individual vendor rows are truncated —
-- the export computes "N more vendors, $X" from the gap.
