-- Mart: SF employee compensation by fiscal year
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_comp (FILTERED to year_type = 'Fiscal' here — the
--          mart is where the Calendar/Fiscal choice is made, per the
--          core-keeps-both rule), int_us_sf_comp_employee_year (person
--          grain — median and the OT-exceeds-salary counters are
--          per-person statements), core_us_sf_population (per-resident,
--          Census years 2020-2025), stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal year, 2013-2025.
--
-- n_employees = distinct pseudonymous employee identifiers (headcount-ish,
-- includes part-year and part-time staff — NOT FTE). median/avg per-employee
-- comp are computed on per-employee annual totals from the intermediate
-- (an employee can have several rows across jobs/departments); the median
-- is EXACT (PERCENTILE_CONT), not an approximate sketch — it is the page's
-- hero number and must be deterministic.
--
-- n_ot_exceeds_salary_floored uses the documented $1,000 salary floor
-- (int_us_sf_comp_employee_year header: the FY2019 naive count is an
-- artifact of job-change rows with ≤$1k salaries). The floor value is
-- exposed as a column so the export/UI reads it from data, never hardcodes.
--
-- per_resident_usd only exists where a same-year Census estimate exists
-- (2020-2025); SF FY N ends Jun 30 of year N, so the July 1 estimate of
-- year N is the FY-end population (same rule as mart_us_sf_budget_by_year).
