-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF payroll distribution per fiscal year — percentiles, threshold
--       counts and a $25k-bucket histogram (citywide only, v1)
--
-- Sources: int_us_sf_comp_employee_year (person grain — distribution
--          statements are per-person), stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal year, 2013-2025 (histogram as an ARRAY<STRUCT> column).
--
-- Percentiles are EXACT (PERCENTILE_CONT). p10 IS NOT PUBLISHED — the
-- study measured it as part-timer pollution (FY2025: 10.3% of employees
-- under $25k are part-time/partial-year), an invitation to "poverty
-- wages" misreads. The published floor is p25; the low histogram bump is
-- annotated in the UI instead.
--
-- Histogram: 20 buckets of $25,000 from $0 to $500k, plus
-- n_at_or_above_500k so that Σ bucket + top == n_employees exactly
-- (tests/us/assert_us_sf_payroll_distribution_identity.sql). 235
-- employee-years across 13 years have NEGATIVE net comp (adjustment
-- rows); they are counted in the $0-25k bucket for the histogram
-- (GREATEST(comp, 0)) and exposed via n_negative_comp. Sparse top-tail
-- buckets (n < 5, only 2013-2016) are merged into an open top bucket at
-- EXPORT time — the mart keeps raw buckets, the export applies the
-- publication rule and the validator asserts it.
--
-- Threshold counts (>$200k…>$500k) are citywide COUNT-ONLY disclosures
-- (no dollar aggregate attached) and are published exactly, including
-- values under 5 (FY2013 has exactly one employee above $400k) — the
-- méthode section states this choice; every dollar-carrying cell in the
-- payroll exports covers ≥ 5 people.
