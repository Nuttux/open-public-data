-- Mart: SF payroll by department × job family × fiscal year — the drill
--       grain, with the dial-B small-cell rule applied IN the mart
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_comp (year_type = 'Fiscal'), stg_us_sf_job_reclass
--          (103 junk job codes → real families, in-session seed),
--          stg_us_sf_job_family_display (60 family codes → 16 display
--          families, in-session seed), stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  department_code × job_family_code (effective) × fiscal year —
--         plus one pooled "_POOLED" row per department-year where small
--         cells could be pooled. ~5-6k rows over 13 years.
--
-- FAMILY DIMENSION. The source's native job_family is 100% populated
-- (59 codes — no AI classification needed, block study §3). Two fixes on
-- top, both provenance-flagged seeds:
--   1. reclass: rows whose native family is junk ("Untitled" 0000 /
--      "Unassigned") take the family assigned by seed_us_sf_job_reclass
--      (court xxC codes → SF Superior Court, mayoral staff → Management,
--      commissioners → synthetic ELEC…). Never overrides a real value;
--      is_reclassified marks affected cells.
--   2. display_family: 16 citizen-readable groups from
--      seed_us_sf_job_family_display. An unmapped future family code
--      falls back to its own native label (self-labeling, visible) and
--      trips the accepted_values test — extend the seed, don't hide it.
--
-- PRIVACY (dial B, approved by Daniel — measured cost 1.25% of FY2025 $,
-- 1.27% all-years): a cell is published only with n ≥ 5 distinct
-- employees. Sub-threshold cells are pooled per department-year into ONE
-- visible "Other roles" row (family_code '_POOLED', n_pooled_families
-- exposed — zero silent suppression). If the pool itself has n < 5 it is
-- NOT published either (defeats subtraction-recovery of a near-individual
-- cell): those dollars stay in the department totals
-- (mart_us_sf_payroll_by_dept_year) with no family row — asserted by
-- tests/us/assert_us_sf_payroll_family_cells_reconcile.sql. Departments
-- below the dept-level threshold (Law Library…) get no family rows at all.
