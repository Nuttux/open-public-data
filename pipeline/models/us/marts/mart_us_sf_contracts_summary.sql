-- Mart: SF supplier contracts — ONE ROW PER CONTRACT (prime-dedupe grain)
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_contracts (48,350 team-member rows),
--          stg_us_sf_purchasing_authority_families (display families seed),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  contract_no — 31,860 contracts with at least one prime row.
--
-- Dedupe rules (docs/us/block-studies/3-contracts.md, all query-verified):
--   * Money = SUM over PRIME rows per contract_no. 40 contracts carry two
--     prime rows whose amounts are ADDITIVE amendments (incl. negative
--     rows, e.g. 1000035538: $1,230,342.68 and −$824,329.58) — summing is
--     the correct netting. Summing ALL 48,350 rows would inflate agreed by
--     ~$8.1B of sub/JV rows (tests/us/assert_us_sf_contracts_summary_total).
--   * The 75 sub-only contracts (no prime row) are EXCLUDED — their rows
--     carry team-member attachments, not a contract-level award.
--   * consumed_amt NEVER enters this mart: measured garbage (one rec
--     center shows $83.35B consumed on a $140.3M award; citywide it sums
--     to $118.37B vs $93.06B agreed). The source's remaining column is
--     referenced ONLY inside src_arithmetic_consistent (a boolean that
--     says whether the source's own agreed = paid + remaining identity
--     holds) and is never carried as a value.
--   * "Remaining" = GREATEST(agreed − paid, 0) (remaining_calc_usd), always
--     displayed with the reconciliation flag.
--   * paid_usd is the source's pmt_amt = lifetime voucher payments
--     (spot-verified vs the voucher join at ±0.1%) — voucher sums are the
--     only contract money we publish. paid > agreed on ~1,053 contracts
--     (construction-heavy): payments accumulate across modifications while
--     agreed reflects the base document — a méthode note, not an error.
--
-- Flags:
--   * is_sole_source: sole_source_flg='X' on ANY row of the contract (the
--     flag sometimes lives on team rows; 1,314 of the register's 1,316
--     flagged contracts have a prime row and appear here).
--   * is_active: term_end >= today (America/Los_Angeles). NULL end dates
--     (370 contracts) are is_active=NULL — an explicit unknown bucket,
--     never counted as active. Placeholder 2200-12-31 dates were already
--     NULLed in stg (term_end_date_is_placeholder).
