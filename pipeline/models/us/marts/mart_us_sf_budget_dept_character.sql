-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF adopted budget, department × character cells — the fiche altitude
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, stg_us_sf_character_glosses (display
--          enrichment), stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × department × character (the SF equivalent of
--         the Paris chapitre/poste fiche altitude — ~460 spending + ~330
--         revenue nonzero cells per modern FY, measured 2026-07-16).
--
-- FY2018 excluded (corrupted-drill year — see mart_us_sf_budget_dept).
-- Zero cells (|amount| ≤ $0.005) are dropped; transfer-adjustment cells are
-- KEPT and flagged is_transfer_adjustment so exports carry them as labeled
-- lines (never silently netted, never inside share/length visuals).
-- gloss/display_category only exist for modern-era character codes.
