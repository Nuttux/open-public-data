-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF adopted budget, department × character × object cells — the
-- raw line-item detail one level below the fiche altitude
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × department × character × object.
--
-- WHY THIS IS RAW DETAIL, NOT A HEADLINE DRILL LEVEL (measured, docs/us/
-- block-studies/1-budget.md §1, §2): object labels are only ~25-50%
-- plain-English on a random sample ("Sciap (Specialized Care) Svcs",
-- "ITO To 5L-Lagna Hnda Hosptl Fd") — no gloss enrichment exists for this
-- dimension. dept×object is 2,633 cells FY2026, ~5.7x the dept×character
-- cell count — too many to rank as a fiche section, right as an expandable
-- "line items" list underneath a character the user has already selected.
--
-- FY2018 excluded (corrupted-drill year — see mart_us_sf_budget_dept).
-- Zero cells (|amount| ≤ $0.005) are dropped; transfer-adjustment cells are
-- KEPT and flagged, same doctrine as mart_us_sf_budget_dept_character.
