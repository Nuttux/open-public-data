-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF payroll — what KIND of work sits at each pay level
--       (fiscal year × display job family: percentiles + $25k histogram)
--
-- Sources: int_us_sf_comp_employee_year (person × year totals — the unit of
--          analysis for every distribution statement on the site),
--          core_us_sf_comp (job codes, to attribute a person to a family),
--          stg_us_sf_job_reclass / stg_us_sf_job_family_display (the same
--          two provenance-flagged seeds the family marts use),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal year × display_family (the 16 citizen-readable groups the
--         page names — percentiles CANNOT be rolled up from a finer grain,
--         so they are computed here at the grain the UI reads), plus one
--         '_OTHER' row per fiscal year holding the cells too small to publish.
--
-- WHY THIS MART. mart_us_sf_payroll_distribution answers "how is city pay
-- spread?" but not "who is where in that spread?" — the histogram is a wall
-- of anonymous bars. This mart carries the same person-grain distribution
-- CUT BY job family, so the page can answer both:
--   1. the pay ladder — each family's p25 / median / p75, sorted;
--   2. bucket composition — for a $25k band, which families are in it.
--
-- PRIMARY FAMILY. A person can be paid under several job codes in a year.
-- They are counted ONCE, under the family that paid them the most
-- (deterministic tie-break on family_code) — the same rule
-- mart_us_sf_payroll_high_earner_titles uses for primary title. Their WHOLE
-- annual compensation is attributed to that family, so
--   Σ n_people_primary over families = citywide n_employees,
--   Σ histogram cells over families = the citywide histogram
-- exactly (tests/us/assert_us_sf_payroll_family_distribution_reconciles.sql).
-- This is deliberately NOT the same measure as n_employees in
-- mart_us_sf_payroll_by_family_year, which counts a dual-role person in both
-- families: that mart splits dollars, this one splits people.
--
-- PRIVACY. Percentile rows are published only for families with ≥ 5 people
-- (dial B). Histogram cells are counts with no dollar amount attached, but a
-- named cell of 1 would still place one person in a $25k band, so named
-- cells under 5 are pooled per fiscal year into the '_OTHER' row —
-- count-only, naming no family. The pooled row itself is NOT thresholded:
-- it is arithmetically derivable from what is already public (the citywide
-- bucket count in mart_us_sf_payroll_distribution minus the named cells of
-- that bucket), so suppressing it would hide nothing while breaking the
-- Σ = citywide identity the test relies on. Nothing is dropped.
