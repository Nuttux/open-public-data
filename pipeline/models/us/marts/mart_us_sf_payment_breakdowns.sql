-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF payments sliced three ways — who paid, which service area, what
-- kind of payee
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers, stg_us_sf_payee_buckets, stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:   fiscal_year × dimension × key.
--
-- WHY. The who-gets-paid page had exactly ONE breakdown (what the money
-- bought) against the contracts page's four, so the reader could see what was
-- purchased and never who paid for it. These are the missing lenses, and they
-- are built to be TOGGLED: every dimension here sums to the same denominator,
-- the fiscal year's total payments, so switching lens re-cuts one pie instead
-- of quietly changing what is being measured.
--
--   department — the paying department (the City's own code).
--   org_group  — the Controller's seven service areas. The budget page's own
--                top-level grouping, so the two pages cut the money the same
--                way and a reader can carry one into the other.
--   kind       — the display bucket from seed_us_sf_payee_buckets (supplier /
--                nonprofit / healthcare / fiscal agent / pass-through /
--                person). Unmatched vendors land in 'unclassified' rather
--                than being dropped: the seed covers ~80% of dollars and the
--                gap is a fact about the classification, not a rounding
--                error to hide.
--
-- Labels are the dominant spelling by dollars, never MAX() on a display
-- string — the FY2018 PeopleSoft migration re-cased every department name, so
-- grouping on the label would split one department into two rows.
--
-- Totals are NET (refund lines included) and therefore tie to the same FY
-- total mart_us_sf_payees_by_fy publishes. `person` rows are kept in the
-- totals and labelled by the UI, never featured — the personnes-physiques
-- doctrine is a display rule, not a reason to under-count the ledger.
