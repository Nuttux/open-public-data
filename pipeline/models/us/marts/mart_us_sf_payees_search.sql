-- Mart: SF payees search index — one row per vendor, lazy-loaded by the UI
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers, stg_us_sf_payee_buckets, stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:  vendor (union of every fiscal year's top 1,000 payees by $ —
--         measured 4,068 vendors covering ≈95-97% of every FY's dollars,
--         docs/us/block-studies/2-payees.md §2.2). The all-time universe is
--         71,710 raw names; the tail beyond the union is $-immaterial for
--         search and contains most person-like names (privacy: kept out).
--
-- Feeds payees_search.json — the Paris beneficiaires_search.json pattern:
-- fetched on first query, searched client-side. by_year carries the
-- vendor's FULL per-FY series (not just years where it made the top 1,000).
-- `bucket` rides along so person-bucket rows can render per the
-- personnes-physiques doctrine (labeled "individual payee", never featured).
