-- Mart: who got paid for work at a place (Block 6C — the payee chain)
--
-- Grain: one row per (place_slug, vendor).
--
-- place → its matched contracts (stg_us_sf_place_contracts) → vouchers
-- (core_us_sf_vouchers on contract_number) → vendor + ACTUAL $ paid, with the
-- fiscal-year span. This is the "voucher/payee projects based in a location"
-- reconstruction: the real builders/operators paid on the place's contracts.
--
-- Money note: vouchers_paid is actual disbursement. It is the SAME money as the
-- contract `paid` and (for bond-funded work) the bond `expended` — a different
-- ledger view, never summed across sources (see mart_us_sf_place_capital).
