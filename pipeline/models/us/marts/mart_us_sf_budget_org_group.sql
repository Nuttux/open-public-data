-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × organization group, FY2010-FY2027 (all years:
--         the 7 org groups and their labels are the ONLY dimension stable
--         across the FY2018 chart-of-accounts break — verified live

-- Totals are NET (transfer-adjustment rows stay in, exposed separately as
-- transfer_adjustment_usd). share_of_side is the group's share of the NET
-- fiscal-year total on its side.
