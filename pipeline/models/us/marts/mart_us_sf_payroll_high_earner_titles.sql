-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: composition of the >$400k group, latest fiscal year — COUNT-ONLY
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_comp + int_us_sf_comp_employee_year (Fiscal),
--          stg_us_sf_job_reclass / stg_us_sf_job_family_display (family
--          context), stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  job title (primary title per person) among employees whose
--         TOTAL annual compensation exceeds $400k — top titles with
--         n ≥ 5, plus one remainder row. NO dollar columns: this mart
--         exists so the page's "public-safety supervisors and
--         physicians" framing is pipeline data, not prose (zero-hardcode
--         rule). Counts attach no amounts beyond ">$400k".
--
-- A person can hold several titles in a year; they are counted once,
-- under the title that paid them the most (deterministic tie-break on
-- job_code).
