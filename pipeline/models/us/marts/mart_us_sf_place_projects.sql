-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: current & recent DPW projects on/near a place (Block 6C — spatial view)
--
-- Grain: one row per (place_slug, project_name) — the nearest point of each
-- distinct DPW project to any of the place's facility points.
--
-- The STRUCTURED spatial join: the place's facility coordinates
-- (stg_us_sf_city_facilities via the crosswalk) → DPW project points within
-- PROXIMITY_M (ST_DWITHIN). DPW is SF's geolocated chantiers feed; this is the
-- "construction physically on/near this place" view. Carries NO money of its
-- own (client_contract_id bridges to a contract's $ where present) — an
-- activity list, never summed into a place total. Pre-Planning + Active +
-- recent are the useful states; ancient completed noise is dropped by requiring
-- a project_status and a non-null geometry.
--
-- Proximity is deliberately tight (120 m) — a facility centroid within 120 m of
-- a project point means the chantier is at/adjacent to the parcel, not merely
-- in the neighborhood. Honestly labeled "on or near this place" downstream.
