-- Mart: capital & construction at a place (Block 6B+) — the UNIFIED, NO-SUM
-- capital model.
--
-- Grain: one row per (place_slug, source, item_key) — a distinct piece of
-- capital work at the place, from whichever ledger names it.
--
-- CRITICAL DOCTRINE (docs/us/block-studies/6-lieux.md §capital no-sum): the
-- capital ledgers are OVERLAPPING views of the same physical work —
--     GO bond `expended`  ⊇  contract `paid`  ≈  building-permit declared value
-- (a bond fund PAYS the contracts; the permit is the same job's declared cost).
-- So every row carries an explicit `amount_measure`, and totals are only ever
-- taken WITHIN one measure, NEVER summed across sources. The fiche groups by
-- source and labels each measure; it shows no cross-ledger grand total.
--
-- Sources wired so far:
--   bond_item    — GO bond program item that IS this place → amount_measure
--                  'bond_expended', amount = latest cumulative expended.
--   bond_project — named bond-funded project at the place → amount NULL
--                  (program-level $, shown as work, not an exact per-place total).
--   contract     — prime contract naming the place → amount_measure
--                  'contract_paid', amount = lifetime paid (voucher-derived).
-- (dpw / permit sources are added by later blocks against this same grain.)
