-- Mart: SF top payees by fiscal year — vouchers paid per FY × vendor
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers (8.07M rows → FY × vendor rollup),
--          core_us_sf_contracts (grant-contract join, FY2018+),
--          stg_us_sf_payee_buckets (manual bucket classification),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × vendor, top 100 payees per FY by vouchers_paid.
--
-- READ THIS before ranking (docs/us/API-RECON.md §A.3): the top of a naive
-- ranking is banks/fiscal agents (JPMorgan $1.86B FY2025 — debt service and
-- pass-throughs), NOT service providers. `bucket` annotates payees from the
-- MANUAL classification seed (fiscal_agent_debt_service /
-- payroll_passthrough / healthcare / nonprofit / supplier / other / person);
-- NULL bucket = unclassified. The seed join is per exact vendor string, so a
-- classified string carries its bucket into every fiscal year it appears in
-- (two-layer strategy, docs/us/block-studies/2-payees.md §2.4). Vendor
-- names are unkeyed portal strings (BNY Mellon appears under 2 spellings —
-- both classified in the seed).
--
-- Block 2 additions (2026-07-16):
--   objects_top3        — top 3 `object` labels by $ for the row (display
--                         context: "what they're paid for");
--   grant_funded_usd    — $ of the row's vouchers paid under contracts SF
--                         classifies as 'Grant Contract%' ("City as
--                         Grantor"); contract numbers exist FY2018+ only,
--                         so pre-2018 this is NULL, not 0;
--   is_aggregation_line — the Controller's aggregated vendor lines
--                         ('Single Payment Payees', …) that are NOT one
--                         entity and must never render as a plain payee;
--   execution_status    — closed / recently_closed_preliminary /
--                         in_progress (SF-BUILD-PLAN cross-cutting rule 2).
