-- Mart: US public debt series — export shape for the debt time-machine
--
-- Source: core_us_debt (+ stg_us_fiscaldata_catalog for provenance).
-- Grain:  (series, record_date), three series:
--   - 'annual_fy_end' : fiscal-year-end totals 1790 → latest closed FY
--                       (Historical Debt Outstanding)
--   - 'month_end'     : last business day per calendar month, 1993-04 →
--                       (downsampled from Debt to the Penny — the full
--                       daily series stays queryable in core_us_debt)
--   - 'latest'        : the single most recent daily observation
--
-- Amounts in DOLLARS. The annual and daily-based series treat FFB debt
-- differently (per the datasets' published notes) — never splice them
-- into one continuous line.
