-- Mart: SF payroll by department × fiscal year — PUBLISHED rows only
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_comp (year_type = 'Fiscal'), stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:  department_code × fiscal year, 2013-2025 (~730 published rows).
--
-- KEYED ON department_code — the #1 payroll trap (block study §5, bug
-- reproduced live): department LABELS break at FY2017 ("POL Police" →
-- "Police"; 61 codes ↔ 125 label pairs). Codes are stable across all 13
-- years; every row carries the CANONICAL label = the label of the code's
-- most recent year. Grouping by label instead of code silently zeroes
-- every pre-2017 department series.
--
-- PRIVACY (dial B, approved): department-years with fewer than 5 distinct
-- employees are NOT published — in practice the Law Library (n=2-3 every
-- year), one Sheriff-oversight code (n=1, FY2022) and two FY2017 rows with
-- a NULL department code. Their dollars stay inside the citywide totals
-- (mart_us_sf_comp_by_year) but get no department row; the fold is
-- ≤ $560k/yr (≤0.01% of comp) and is asserted ≤ 4 employees/yr by
-- tests/us/assert_us_sf_payroll_dept_totals_match_by_year.sql. Org-group
-- totals must always be computed FROM these published rows (never
-- independently), so the fold cannot be recovered by subtraction.
--
-- median_total_comp_usd is the median of per-employee totals WITHIN the
-- department (an employee working in two departments counts in each, with
-- the comp earned there) — exact PERCENTILE_CONT, not a sketch.
