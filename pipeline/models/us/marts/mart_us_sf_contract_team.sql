-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF contract project teams — who is on each contract, in what role
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_contracts, stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  contract_no × supplier × role × LBE status (amendment rows for
--         the same member are netted by the SUM, like the prime dedupe).
--
-- NEVER UNION THIS INTO CONTRACT MONEY (docs/us/block-studies/3-contracts.md
-- §4): attached_usd on non-prime rows lives in the PRIME's envelope — on
-- 486 of 2,171 contracts with named subs the sub total even exceeds the
-- prime agreed (reconciliation gap in the source). Team rows feed the fiche
-- "project team" tab and the LBE participation aggregates, both rendered as
-- their own labeled perimeter. Register money comes exclusively from
-- mart_us_sf_contracts_summary.
--
-- Roles as published: Prime Contractor / Subcontractor / Joint Venture
-- Constituent. LBE participation beyond primes = Subcontractor + JV rows
-- with LBE status (7,801 rows on 1,921 contracts, $3.15B attached).
