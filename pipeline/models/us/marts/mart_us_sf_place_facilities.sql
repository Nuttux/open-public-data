-- Mart: per-place facility identity (Block 6A lieux backbone)
--
-- Grain: one row per place_slug.
--
-- Rolls the reviewed place↔facility crosswalk up to the structured identity a
-- fiche shows: the PRIMARY building (nearest-to-seed, from the crosswalk) for
-- address/APN/size, plus campus aggregates (how many buildings, total sq ft,
-- owned vs leased) and the DISTINCT APN list — the key the Building Permits
-- join (6D) will use. Facility attributes are read LIVE from
-- stg_us_sf_city_facilities (the registry is the source of truth; the seed
-- only fixes which facility_ids belong to the place).
--
-- Identity only — asserts no money. The APN list it exposes is what turns a
-- place into a parcel key for downstream structured money joins.
