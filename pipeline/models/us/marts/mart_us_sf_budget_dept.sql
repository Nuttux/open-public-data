-- Mart: SF adopted budget by department — the page's second altitude
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_budget, stg_us_sf_dept_names (display enrichment),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × side × department.
--
-- FY2018 IS EXCLUDED: it is a corrupted-drill year — the budget dataset
-- mixes both chart-of-accounts systems and carries DUPLICATE department
-- identities ("Public Health" and "DPH Public Health" simultaneously) plus
-- ~21k zero-value modern-code skeleton rows (measured, docs/us/
-- block-studies/1-budget.md §7). Citywide/org-group FY2018 series live in
-- mart_us_sf_budget_by_year / mart_us_sf_budget_org_group.
--
-- total_usd is NET (embedded negative transfer-adjustment rows stay in —
-- attached at dept level across ~44 depts); transfer_adjustment_usd exposes
-- that netting per department so the UI can carry it as a labeled line.
-- display_name (seed enrichment) only exists for modern-era codes; the
-- source label is always carried alongside, never overwritten.
