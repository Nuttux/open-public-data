-- =============================================================================
-- Mart: SF payee profile — what one payee is actually paid for
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers (row-level payment lines),
--          mart_us_sf_payees_search (the vendor universe),
--          stg_us_sf_subobject_class (purchase / obligation / ledger),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:   one row per vendor (raw Controller display string).
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. The payee fiche had money and nothing else: a total, a
-- bar per fiscal year, and a bare list of department NAMES with no amounts.
-- Paris fills that slot for free — a supplier is keyed by SIREN, so SIRENE
-- returns its activity label, legal form, head office and headcount
-- (FournisseurFiche). SF vendors carry no identifier at all, so there is no
-- registry to join and the fiche said nothing about the payee.
--
-- What the voucher file DOES carry is the City's own account coding on every
-- line: which department paid, and which sub-object it was booked to
-- ("Food", "Interpreters", "Lumber", "Rent/Lease-Building/Structure"). That
-- answers the reader's real question — what does the City pay them FOR —
-- from the source itself, with no enrichment and nothing invented.
--
-- Three rollups, each per vendor:
--   departments  — all-time department split WITH dollars (the fiche used to
--                  render these as a "·"-joined name list).
--   categories   — FY2018+ sub-object split, carrying spend_class so a
--                  payee whose money is debt service or a benefit plan is
--                  not described as though the City bought something.
--   recent_lines — the vendor's most recent CLOSED fiscal year, broken into
--                  department x sub-object lines. This is the honest analog
--                  of Paris's dated "recent contracts" table: SF vouchers
--                  carry NO payment date, only fiscal_year, so a dated
--                  ledger cannot be built from this source — the last closed
--                  year's composition is as close as the data allows.
--
-- FY2018 floor on categories (NOT on departments): the chart of accounts was
-- renumbered that year, so a sub-object series across the break silently
-- splits — the same floor mart_us_sf_spending_subobjects already respects.
-- Department names survive the break, so their rollup stays all-time.
--
-- Totals are NET (refund/credit lines included) so a vendor's rollups tie to
-- its own by_year series in payees_search. Negative cells are kept in the
-- data and filtered at the display layer, never silently dropped here.
