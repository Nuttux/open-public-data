-- Mart: SF contract spend curves — vouchers paid per contract × fiscal year
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers (8.07M distribution lines, contract_number
--          carried on $55.27B of lifetime payments),
--          mart_us_sf_contracts_summary (the contract register, prime grain),
--          stg_us_sf_catalog (provenance).
-- Grain:  contract_no × fiscal_year, contracts present in the register only.
--
-- Join quality (docs/us/block-studies/3-contracts.md §6, query-verified):
-- 29,048 of 29,842 voucher contract numbers match the register — 97.3% of
-- numbers, 99.1% of joined dollars. Coverage starts FY2018 (PeopleSoft
-- migration: contract numbers change at the break — render the FY2018 note
-- on every curve). Spot-check: Alstom 1000006337 voucher sum $28.57M ≈ the
-- register's lifetime pmt_amt $28.6M.
--
-- execution_status (SF-BUILD-PLAN cross-cutting rule 2) replaces the
-- calendar boolean: SF fiscal year N ends June 30 of year N; the accounting
-- close then runs for months. Labeling rule used here (a display heuristic,
-- documented, not a claim about the Controller's process): in_progress
-- until June 30; recently_closed_preliminary for the 9 months after
-- year-end; closed afterwards.
