-- Mart: SF top nonprofit payees per fiscal year — FY2018+ ONLY
--
-- Sources: core_us_sf_vouchers (is_non_profit flag), core_us_sf_contracts
--          (grant join), stg_us_sf_payee_buckets, stg_us_sf_catalog.
-- Grain:  fiscal_year × vendor, top 30 nonprofit-flagged payees per FY.
--
-- FLOOR (measured, docs/us/block-studies/2-payees.md §1.3):
-- non_profit_indicator is EMPTY before FY2018 (0 rows 2007-2017) — the
-- PeopleSoft migration introduced the flag. This mart therefore starts at
-- FY2018 and the UI renders a floor note; no name-based backfill (would be
-- honest-incomplete at 13.8% of pre-2018 $).
--
-- COMMUNITY RANKING (in_community_ranking + community_rank): the raw
-- nonprofit ranking is topped by Kaiser ($4.35B all-time — employee health
-- premiums), UC Regents and City College — real nonprofits, but not the
-- community-services story. Rows whose bucket is 'healthcare', 'other'
-- (intergovernmental / assessment pass-throughs) or any non-nonprofit
-- bucket are EXCLUDED from community_rank and shown by the UI in a labeled
-- "also flagged nonprofit" note instead. Unclassified (NULL-bucket)
-- flagged vendors stay IN — they are the community long tail.
